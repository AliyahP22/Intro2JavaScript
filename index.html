  <button onclick="myFunction()">Click Here</button>
  <script >
    function myFunction(){
    document.getElementById("greet").style.color="blue"

  <p>After completing my lab, I learned about a new type of code called JavaScript. JavaScript consists of creating a function and programming it using CSS and HTML elements to make it work. In this specific lab, I made a button that allowed the user to change the color of the "Hello world" by clicking the button. In order to create a function, you go to the index. html file and use the script tag. Then you can use the function. You can do this by typing "function my function(){". This would allow you to create a function. Then you can change the CSS of the function by using document. get element by. For this specfic lab, I made an id for my function so I was able to use the getelementbyid and this would allow you to change the CSS. All in all, I learned that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all have some sort of connection in order to make our website look better. </p>
